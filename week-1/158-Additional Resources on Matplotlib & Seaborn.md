## Learning Resources

Hello Learners,

Here are some more interesting learners resources that you can refer to learn more about data visualization libraries.

* [Introduction to Data Visualization](https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-data-visualization-in-python-89a54c97fbed) (you may consider opening an incognito window if it is asking for a premium upgrade).
* Seaborn library official [introduction](https://seaborn.pydata.org/introduction.html) and [tutorials](https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial.html).
* Matplotlib library [official tutorials](https://matplotlib.org/3.2.1/tutorials/index.html).

Note: As mentioned, there is no need to memorize code; you can follow the tutorials, get the code snippets and apply them in any context. Learn how to read the code and understand what every line of code is doing!

## Real-world implementation of Visualization

You must look at this real-life implementation of putting data science skills into practice. Thanks, @Pascal Wiltschko (Coach), for coming up with this. This was made to create learners' progress reports among his group of learners. You can also access the Colab notebook below.

## Pascal's Visualization Notebook

Dataset: The data is learners' data for quizzes on the DPhi Learning Platform. So it is a real dataset :)

* Link to the Dataset:  
[DPhi Learner Groups Dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dphi-official/Datasets/master/DPhi%20-%20Learners%20-%20Beginners%20%26%20Absolute%20Beginners%20-%20Real%20Dataset%20-%20DPhi_Learners.csv)
* His original notebook can be found [here](https://github.com/dphi-official/Data\_Science\_Bootcamp/blob/master/Advanced\_Material/Leaderboard\_Plots/Leader\_board\_plots\_original.ipynb)**.**

Note: Just learn by understanding the code, and if possible, play with the dataset. Caution: There are a lot of null values, so be careful and don't get overwhelmed. We will learn more about treating missing values soon!
